Notes:
1. (Server/Map Change Plug-in/Online Software can skip this) Left 4 Dead 2 only can display 15 levels, So 16-33 levels and 49-66 levels can not be selected. Players without Server/Map Change Plug-in/Online Software should plan the time (33 levels about 6 hours).
Of course, it is suggested to go to the next plug-in to change the diagram:
Https://tieba.baidu.com/p/5420191211?Pid=114983446748&cid=&red_tag=1729346763
2. Because of engine limitation, most of the levels can not be merged. So some of them will be too long/too short.
3. Because of the different games, the author made some modifications to the original game map.
4.Command nb_delete_all at some levels will can not pass, which can only be restarted this level.
5. If the game crash, remove mods to avoid mod conflicts.


Remarks:
1. At present, there are two materials missing from the map. The author has tried many times and can't solve them. Maybe they will be repaired when the subsequent version is updated.
